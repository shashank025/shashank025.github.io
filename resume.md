## Professional Experience

### Google, Inc

January 2019 -- _present_ | _Software Engineer_

* Tech Lead on the Google Pay team.

### Facebook Inc

2017 -- 2018 | Engineering Manager
2015 -- 2017 | Software Engineer

* Founding member and Tech Lead for Lead Ads, a News Feed ad product
that gives people a quick and privacy-safe way to sign up to receive
info from businesses; now responsible for nontrivial fraction of
overall FB revenue (cannot share exact numbers).

* As TL, I built **save/prefill**: (improves submission rates by 50%),
**lead download via CSV** (covers 50% of revenue); identified and
solved the hardest problems (1% of lead submissions failing);
architected and led 2 eng in building new UI that lets advertisers
integrate with CRMs right from within Facebook Ads Manager
(improved CRM adoption rate by 20%);
identified proxy metrics for lead quality (challenge: no ground truth),
and drove 20% improvement on those metrics via iterating on form filling
user experience: now adopted by 10% of revenue.

* As Engineering Manager, I supported 5 engineers;
drove major revenue growth by enabling advertisers to use lead forms
within other ad objectives (10% incremental revenue in one half);
initiated effort to combine client native post-click experiences;
provided direction for improving lead quality by exploiting
Facebook Pixel as a source for downstream performance.

### Adobe Inc

2012 -- 2015 | _Software Architect_

* Designed and implemented a spend control system
for real-time bidding (RTB) campaigns that currently handles
over 1 million requests a second across 4 geographical regions
and manages over $20 million dollars of client spend.

* Conceived, designed and built a real-time audience size estimator
that employs _hyperloglog_ estimates, but also adds
the ability to perform (a limited range of) logical expressions on
audience segments
(_e.g._, "how many people added items to cart,
but did _not_ purchase anything?").

### Efficient Frontier, Inc

2010 -- 2012 | _Sr. Software Engineer_
2007 -- 2010 | _Core Platform Engineer_

* Designed, implemented and maintained a significant portion of
backend infrastructure for Efficient Frontier's
online marketing platform, including
syncing massive amounts of clients' marketing data into our
sharded PostgreSQL instances,
a distributed dependency-based
workflow engine, early versions of our retail offering,
automatic version management for PostgreSQL tables,
change history, slow database query optimization (30X speedups),
etc.

* Gained deep understanding of online marketing:
search, social and display (including RTB).

### Teragram Corp, Inc

2005 -- 2007 | _Software Engineer_

* Involved in design, development and maintenance of
Teragram _Direct Answers_
-- a system to provide precise answers to
user queries (_e.g._, "who shot abraham lincoln?").

* Designed and developed a highly customizable
"pipeline" for automated, continuous indexing of
huge amounts of documents.

* Customized both applications into a solution for
several major web portals and news organizations,
serving thousands of user search queries every hour.
