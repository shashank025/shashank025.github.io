I have considerable experience with (and a passion for) building scalable software systems.

### Projects/Code

[https://github.com/shashank025](https://github.com/shashank025)

### Education

2005 | _Sc.M. Computer Science_ | Brown University, Providence RI, USA.
2003 | _B.E. (Hons.) Computer Science_ | Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.


### Professional Experience

2012 -- _present_ | _Software Architect_ | Adobe Systems, Inc.
2010 -- 2012 | _Sr. Software Engineer_ | Efficient Frontier, Inc.
2007 -- 2010 | _Core Platform Engineer_ | Efficient Frontier, Inc.

* Designed and implemented a spend control system
for real-time bidding (RTB) campaigns that currently handles
over 1 million requests a second across 4 geographical regions
and manages over $20 million dollars of client spend.

* Conceived, designed and built a real-time audience size estimator
that employs _hyperloglog_ estimates, but also adds
the ability to perform (a limited range of) logical expressions on
audience segments
(_e.g._, "how many people added items to cart,
but did _not_ purchase anything?").

* Designed, implemented and maintained a significant portion of
backend infrastructure for Efficient Frontier's
online marketing platform, including
syncing massive amounts of clients' marketing data into our
sharded PostgreSQL instances, 
a distributed dependency-based
workflow engine, early versions of our retail offering,
automatic version management for PostgreSQL tables,
change history, slow database query optimization (30X speedups),
etc.

* Gained deep understanding of online marketing:
search, social and display (including RTB).


2005 -- 2007 | _Software Engineer_  | Teragram Corporation.

* Involved in design, development and maintenance of
Teragram _Direct Answers_
-- a system to provide precise answers to
user queries (_e.g._, "who shot abraham lincoln?").

* Designed and developed a highly customizable
"pipeline" for automated, continuous indexing of
huge amounts of documents.

* Customized both applications into a solution for
several major web portals and news organizations,
serving thousands of user search queries every hour.


### Languages/Interests

Python, PostgreSQL, Bash, C, Java,
Javascript, machine learning,
and visualization (`d3.js`).
