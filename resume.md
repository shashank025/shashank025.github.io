### Education

* Brown University, Providence RI, USA, _Sc.M. Computer Science_, 2005.
* Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, _B.E. (Hons.) Computer Science_, 2003.


### Representative Experience

#### Software Architect at Adobe Systems, Inc., 2012 -- _present_.

#### Sr. Software Engineer at Efficient Frontier, Inc., 2010 -- 2012.

#### Core Platform Engineer at Efficient Frontier, Inc., 2007 -- 2010.


* Designed and implemented a spend control system
for real-time bidding (RTB) campaigns that currently handles
over 1 million requests a second across 4 geographical regions
and manages over $20 million dollars of client spend.

* Conceived, designed and built a real-time audience size estimator
that employs _hyperloglog_ estimates, but also adds
the ability to perform (a limited range of) logical expressions on
audience segments
(_e.g._, "how many people added items to cart,
but did _not_ purchase anything?").
