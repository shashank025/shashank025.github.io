My name is Shashank Ramaprasad. I am currently a Software Architect at Adobe, Inc.,
where I am building software systems for online advertising in the Media Optimizer group.

I plan to use this blog to write about technical stuff, with a focus on
software infrastructure, scalability, and occasionally some math and computer science.

I grew up in Bangalore, India, and I now live in San Francisco, CA.
